<h2>App changes made from design phase</h2>
Multiple changes were made to the application since the design phase, but the base idea stayed the same, the changes made are:
<b>Feature 1: View Category List</b>
-	No changes were made
<b>Feature 2: Add/Edit New Category</b>
-	The + button was moved below the category list as a design choice so it is displayed where the user would want the new category to appear.
-	The Edit and Delete button were originally displayed on the page. They are now accessed by swiping a category and revealing them instead. This design choice was made to clean up the look of the page and make better use of the tableviewcontroller.
<b>Feature 3: View List of Items for selected Category</b>
-	The Delete button is now accessed by swiping the item and revealing it.
-	The price displayed for each item was removed due to it making the page look cluttered and messy.
<b>Feature 4: View Details of the selected Item</b>
-	No changes were made
<b>Feature 5: Add/Edit and Item</b>
-	The Category drop-down box has been changed to a Picker to reduce the amount of steps taken for the process and deliver and better user experience.
-	A stepper and text field were added for the Quantity for a better overall user experience and design choice compared to the previous drop down menu.
-	Edit Record was removed to reduce complexity
<b>Feature 6: Update User Settings</b>
-	Removed App Notifications as it did not seem necessary or practical for our overall design and use of the app.
-	Removed PIN Code Security
